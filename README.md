# GalaxyClassification
Given a galaxy image, find the galaxy classification: smooth, 2 arms, 5 arms

Input images are in 3 folders: 2arms, 5arms, smooth.

Run the CropSplit.py to pre-process and generate the training images to 3 folders: S, 2, 5
Run the Analyze program to classify and predict 5 arms vs. 2 arms galaxies

If you want to classify between smooth and arms (2 and 5), 
set the 2 and 5 with same number, then uncomment the smooth input folder block
